***What is LDR??***
LDR stands for Light Dependent Resistor, also known as a photoresistor. It is a light-sensitive component whose resistance changes with the intensity of light falling on it.

-->As same as we done in this project . we just made it simple and defined the basic value as threshold value then defined that whenever the light intensity is more than threshold it doesn't glow , and when light intenity is low , then it glows.

Newly learned is ::
analogRead --> to read the input value at pin A0
