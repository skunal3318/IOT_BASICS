**What is a Potentiometer?**

A potentiometer (or “pot”) is a variable resistor that you can rotate or slide to change its resistance. It's often used as a manual control device — like volume knobs or brightness dials.

**⚙️ Basic Structure:**

It has 3 pins:
  -Pin 1 (VCC) → Connect to 5V
  -Pin 2 (Wiper/Middle pin) → Connect to analog input pin (e.g., A0)
  -Pin 3 (GND) → Connect to GND

Inside, there's a resistive track, and turning the knob moves the wiper across it, changing the resistance ratio between pin 1 and pin 3.

**🔋 How It Works:**

Turning the knob changes the voltage at the middle pin (wiper).
This voltage ranges from 0V to 5V.
When connected to an analog pin, you can read this value with analogRead(), which gives a number from 0 to 1023.
