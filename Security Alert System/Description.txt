🚨 Project Title:

- Security Alert System – LED + Button + Buzzer

📝 Project Description:

- This project simulates a basic home security alarm system using an Arduino Uno. It is designed to alert users of a potential intrusion or emergency by activating both audible and visual signals. When a button is pressed (representing a security trigger), a buzzer sounds and a red LED blinks to simulate an alarm.
- This compact system helps demonstrate core concepts of input/output interfacing, conditional logic, and timing control in Arduino programming.

🎯 Goal:

To simulate a security alert system where:
   - A button acts as the trigger (e.g., intruder detection or emergency button).
   - A buzzer generates an audible alert.
   - A red LED blinks as a visual warning signal.

🧰 Components Used:

  Component     	Description

-Arduino Uno    	Main microcontroller board
-Push Button	    Trigger to simulate intrusion
-Red LED	        Visual alarm indicator
-Buzzer      	    Audible alert device
-Resistors	      Current limiting for LED & button


🔌 Circuit Behavior:

-Default State (Button Not Pressed):
LED and buzzer are off.

-Alert State (Button Pressed):
LED and buzzer turn on for 200ms.

-Then off for 200ms.
This loop continues while the button is pressed, simulating a blinking and beeping alarm.


💻 Code Summary:

-Button connected to pin 2, using internal pull-up.
-Red LED connected to pin 8.
-Buzzer connected to pin 10.
-Uses digitalRead() to detect button press.
-Uses digitalWrite() and delay() to control alarm pattern.


✅ Learning Outcomes:

-Understanding how to use input devices (buttons) with Arduino.
-Interfacing LEDs and buzzers as output devices.
-Using conditional statements (if-else) to control hardware behavior.
-Applying basic timing with delay() to simulate blinking/flashing effects.
