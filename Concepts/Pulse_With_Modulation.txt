Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique used to control the amount of power delivered to an electronic device by varying the duty cycle of a digital signal.

--> How it works??
1). PWM turns a signal on and off very rapidly, but adjusts how long it stays on vs off in each cycle.
2). Duty Cycle: The percentage of time the signal is ON during one complete cycle.
    0% = always OFF
    50% = ON for half the time
    100% = always ON

--> Used in?
LED brightness control 🟡 (dim by lowering duty cycle)
Motor speed control ⚙️ (slow down by reducing ON time)
Audio signal generation
Servo motor positioning (in robotics and IoT!)

--> Use of Capacitor??
When using PWM to simulate analog voltage, a capacitor is often added to the output to smooth the signal. This is especially important when driving devices that expect steady (analog) voltage, like audio equipment, sensors, or analog inputs.
