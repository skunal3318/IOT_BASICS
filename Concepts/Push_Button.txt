***What is the Push Button?? ***

A push button is a simple switch that completes or breaks the circuit when it is pressed .It's a type of digital input device , it has two states ::
1). Pressed(low) --> Circuit is completed
2). Pressed(High) --> Circuit is open.

It's momentary , means only works when it is pressed .

-> If we connect a push button without a resistor then pin float which results in false readings and randomly fluctuate due to non fixed voltage .

üõ°Ô∏è Solution: Use  Pull-Up or Pull-Down Resistors

Type	                           Description	                                    Result
Pull-Down	            Keeps pin LOW until button pressed ‚Üí goes HIGH	           Logic: LOW ‚Üí HIGH
Pull-Up              	Keeps pin HIGH until button pressed ‚Üí goes LOW	           Logic: HIGH ‚Üí LOW

# Advantages of Using Buttons
1). Simple way to get user input
2). Can be used to toggle, control, or navigate
3). Foundation of all interactive electronics (TV remotes, elevator panels, etc.)
