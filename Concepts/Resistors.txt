***What is a Resistor?***
- A resistor is a passive electrical component that resists the flow of electric current. It’s used to control voltage and current in a circuit.
- Measured in Ohms (Ω)
- Follows Ohm’s Law:
                V=I×R
 Where:
    V = Voltage across the resistor (Volts)
    I = Current through the resistor (Amperes)
    R = Resistance (Ohms)

**How Resistors Work**
-A resistor reduces the current or drops the voltage across components. It does this by converting electrical energy into heat.

**Reading Resistor Values (Color Code)**
4-band resistor color code (left to right):
1st band = 1st digit
2nd band = 2nd digit
3rd band = Multiplier
4th band = Tolerance
